               <h1>WALKING ON THE BEACH</h1>
               <p>Empty, cold, windy, the beach in the winter. I walk down a deserted shore with the waves rumbling next
                  to me. Little
                  evidence of life except for a stray gull or a few eider ducks diving just beyond the surf zone. The
                  wind whips sand
                  particles stinging as they hit my face. Walking into the wind takes some effort.

               <h1>Husøy, senja IN NORWAY</h1>
               <p>Geographically, this is a beach I visit often, but it is a very different beach than the one I walked
                  on in the late
                  fall. Winter storms, wind and waves have continued with their eternal reshaping of the landscape.
                  Large sections of sand
                  dunes have eroded in one of the winter storms. The constant wind redistributes clouds of sand along
                  exposed sections of
                  beach. Sand grains collect in clam shells, behind clumps of dune grass or debris, any place that
                  allows relief from the
                  vigorous wind.</p>

               <h1>WAVES</h1>
               <p>In my lifetime, I’ve seen nature’s reshuffling of this beach dozens and dozens of times. As I stroll
                  along the shore, I
                  contemplate the fate of a grain of sand. How many times does a single grain of sand get moved in its
                  life span? How far
                  does it travel in its lifetime? I envision the grain of sand being blown down the beach by the wind
                  and moving in and
                  out on a wave or with the tide. The one constant for a sand grain is motion. The one constant for most
                  beaches is
                  change. With climate change triggering sea level rise and more intense storms, this current rate of
                  change will also
                  change.</p>

               <h1>WHALE</h1>
               <p>It’s time to turn back and as I retrace my steps from the way I came; the wind is now at my back. With
                  the wind at my
                  back, nature doesn’t seem quite as violent. The waves coming ashore don’t look as big. A gull floats
                  effortlessly above
                  me on the wind exerting no effort at all, appearing at peace. The deeper message seems pretty clear,
                  we need to work
                  with nature not against it. Are we as a society, sand grains being blown around haphazardly by the
                  wind or are we the
                  sea gull who can adapt and use that same wind to our advantage? In the distance, three wind turbines
                  are visible on the
                  horizon.</p>

               <p>We’ll stop with that, because now we’re ready to take a tentative step into the very first part of
                  this book. It’s
                  important to have your conceptual framework properly organized, so that you can appreciate where it’s
                  going and what it
                  might possibly mean. And so, well, I’ve done what I can today to….what would you say…elaborate on this
                  single word, I
                  suppose. Hah. But it’s a big word, so it’s not so unreasonable that it takes a long time to get to the
                  point where you
                  have any sense of what it means, at all. That is nowhere near…that is not…I thought I would get a lot
                  farther than that.
                  Hah. Thank you very much.
